  const hobbiesText = `In order to continuously improve myself, I enjoy reading books and listening to audiobooks on a wide range of topics. This habit allows me to expand my knowledge, enhance my personal growth, strengthen my relationships, and gain new perspectives on the world and my own experiences, whether they are in the present, future, or past.

  Additionally, I find solace in physical training as a means to alleviate the challenges that weigh on my mind.
